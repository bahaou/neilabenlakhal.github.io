# [Chapter 6, Docker: a Defacto Platform for Microservices Architecture](https://github.com/neilabenlakhal/neilabenlakhal.github.io/tree/master/2020-2021Lecture/SOC/Chapter_6) 

`Chapter 6, Docker: a Defacto Platform for Microservices Architecture`.  To leverage the benefits of the microservices architectural style, one needs to use technologies aligned with the characteristics of microservices. Containerization has become a popular deployment format for microservices, and Docker is the leading container platform that packages everything needed to deploy and run microservices (i.e., code, libraries, settings, etc.) .With a lot of advantages, Docker become the best fit to implementing microservices architecture. In this Chapter we will dive deep in Docker to see how Docker can effectively help in leveraging microservices architecture. It is mainly intended at laying a solid foundation for the philosophy of containers and microservices that is unlikely to change, no matter what Docker looks like in the coming months and years.

### Before lecture  

üìö **ToRead**

Objectives :  Acquire a deep introduction to the fundamentals of working with Docker. You  will learn how to use Docker effectively, you‚Äôll also grasp how it works, how each detailed feature of Docker ecosystem is meant to be used. You will have the fundamental skillset required to learn advanced topics more quickly if you wish to go further with containerized ventures.

üìù **ToDo**

The objective of this section is to prepare our personal or working environment to work efficiently and effectively with Docker. We will discuss in detail how to set up an ideal environment that can be used when working with Docker containers.


#### Running lecture demos :

In order to run the various lecture demos and examples, you will need either to install Docker Desktop or use PLAY WITH DOCKER. There are lots of ways and places to install Docker. There‚Äôs Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can install in the cloud, on premises, and on your laptop. You will also need also to sign up for a Docker hub account [https://hub.docker.com/signup](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

To get the most out of this chapter, you will need a machine capable of running Docker. This machine should have at least 8 GB RAM and 30 GB HDD free with an Intel i3 processor or above, running one of the following OSes:
   - macOS High Sierra or above 
   - Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise/Education (does not work with Home edition)
   - Ubuntu 18.04 or above

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    `Docker Desktop` on Windows requires 64-bit version of Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise/Education (does not work with Home edition).  Hardware virtualization support must be enabled in your system‚Äôs BIOS The Hyper-V and Containers features must be enabled in Windows. For a most updated version of installation procedure, follow the installation as explained on docker official web site or refer to `Chapter 1` from [Mastering Docker, Fourth Edition, Master this widely used containerization tool, 2020](https://github.com/neilabenlakhal/neilabenlakhal.github.io/blob/master/2020-2021Lecture/SOC/Chapter6/ToRead/9.pdf).


- [PWD](https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker)
    In cas installation on your machine is not possible, you can use [https://labs.play-with-docker.com/] (https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) `PLAY WITH DOCKER (PWD)`. It provides a free-to-use fully functional Docker playground that lasts for 4 hours. You can add multiple nodes and even cluster them in a swarm. Sometimes performance can be slow, but for a free-to-use service it is excellent.

- [Docker HUB Account](https://hub.docker.com) 
    The home page, which can be found at [https://hub.docker.com] (https://hub.docker.com), contains a Sign-Up form and, at the top-right, an option to Sign in. The   odds are that if you have been dabbling with Docker, then you already have a Docker ID. If you don't, use the Sign-Up form on the home page to create one. If you already have a Docker ID, then simply click Sign in. Once logged in, you will be presented with the main Dashboard.
