- You need to Learn:  how to create, clone a repository, push, pull add commit modifications to a remote repository, etc.

- You can use theses resources : 

  * üîó Quick reference guides: [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/), [Visual Git Cheat Sheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html).
  * üîó [Git Book v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

- Install [Git-it (Desktop App)](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases) : Git-it is a desktop (Mac, Windows and Linux) app that teaches you how to use Git and GitHub on the command line. It contains a set of challenges for learning Git and GitHub‚Äîby using real Git and GitHub. You'll be learning Git command lines and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have real repositories on your GitHub account.

- What to submit ?

	Upon finishing the challenges, submit :
